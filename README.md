# coronavirus-tracker

Spring Boot application based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hjNG9GZGnQ) tutorial provided by JavaBrains.

The app collects the daily reports from the [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and displays them in an HTML file that is server-side rendered and styled with Bulma.

To run it locally, configure a local DB in the application.properties file (this app currently uses a PostGreSQL db) and run the application with maven.
